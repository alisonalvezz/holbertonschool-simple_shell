In this project we are expected to make a simple shell.

## What is a "Shell"?
A shell is a **command line** interpreter that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. When a user enters a command, the shell interprets it, searches through the PATH variable to find the corresponding executable file in the system's directories, and executes the command by creating a new process.

## Why making a shell?
- **Task Automation:** A shell allows users to automate common tasks through scripts or command files. This can save time and reduce errors by executing a sequence of commands instead of performing each task manually.
- **Learning and Education:** Creating a shell is an excellent exercise for learning about operating systems, low-level programming, process handling, file handling, and other fundamental concepts.
- **Customization and Extensibility:** When creating a shell, you have full control over its functionality and appearance (like us with the name of the shell). You can customize it according to your needs and add new features or extensions to enhance its functionality.
- **Integration with Existing Systems:** A shell can be integrated with other existing systems or tools, making it easier to automate tasks and facilitate interoperability between different system components.

## Learning objectives:
- Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
- Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
- Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
- Who is Ken Thompson
- How does a shell work
- What is a pid and a ppid
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
- What is the difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- What are the three prototypes of main
- How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
- How to execute another program with the execve system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
- What is EOF / “end-of-file”?

## About our shell:
### Function Main:
Here's the flowchart of our function main and of the shell:
![Main function flowchart](https://github.com/alisonalvezz/holbertonschool-simple_shell/assets/159053351/29fd0653-d85b-4557-bc1e-f5f5ee45206b)
This function serves as the entry point of the program. It runs an infinity loop that repeatedly displays the prompt ("shellula$") using the function ´´´display_prompt´´´, reads a command line using ´´´read_line´´´, executes the command using ´´´execute_command´´´ and frees the memory allocated for the command line.
This loop continues indefinitely until the user explicity exits the shell by entering the command exit.

### Function display_prompt:
Here's the flowchart of the function display_prompt:
